# Breast Cancer Gene Expression Analysis (Academic Exercise)

This repository contains an **academic exercise project** focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of breast cancer gene expression data.  
The project was developed as part of a **scientific algorithms programming course** in Python.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Load and explore gene expression data.
- Visualize distributions of gene expression across breast cancer subtypes.
- Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering.
- Identify relevant genes for specific cancer subtypes.

This project is **not intended for clinical or research use**. It is purely an educational exercise to practice Python programming, data exploration, and basic machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The project uses the **GSE45827 breast cancer gene expression dataset from CuMiDa**, curated and available on Kaggle.

ðŸ”— [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunogrisci/breast-cancer-gene-expression-cumida)

> Download the dataset manually from Kaggle and place it in the `dataset/` folder.

## How to Use

1. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python src/breast_cancer_analysis.py
```

3. Follow the interactive menu to load the dataset, visualize data, perform PCA/clustering, and identify relevant genes.

4. Save results and figures via the menu option.

## Report

A **PDF report** with instructions, screenshots, and visualizations is included in the `report/` folder for reference.
